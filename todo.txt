TODO:  

- Rebuild UI to make Jbrowse and the second DT table as a navlistPanel.
- Process new jbrowse tracks according to modification and target, and then build the jbrowse iframe to dramatically show the tracks.
- Fix the genes that do not match txdb(gtf) on letter case. (to reproduce, try Cdk9)
- Fix the genes that do not exist in txdb (incomplete info? try directly use the GTF files).


DONE (forsaken):

- Make embeded Jbrowse iframe resizable.
